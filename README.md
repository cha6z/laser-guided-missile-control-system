# Active Camber Flutter Suppression

## Overview

This project investigates active camber-based flutter suppression for a two-degree-of-freedom aeroelastic wing section. The objective is to model, analyse, and stabilise an airspeed-dependent aeroelastic system using state-space control methods.

The aeroelastic model represents a typical wing section with plunge (bending) and pitch (torsion) dynamics coupled through quasi-steady aerodynamic forces. As airspeed increases, aerodynamic stiffness and damping modify the structural modes, leading to eigenvalue migration and the onset of flutter instability.

An optimal state-feedback controller is designed using Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) theory to suppress unstable oscillations. An observer is implemented to reconstruct unmeasured states, forming a complete output-feedback control architecture. Closed-loop performance is evaluated under actuator saturation and parameter variation.

## Model Description

The system states are defined as:

x = [ h, h_dot, alpha, alpha_dot ]^T

Where:

- h        : plunge displacement  
- h_dot    : plunge velocity  
- alpha    : torsion angle  
- alpha_dot: torsion rate  

The aerodynamic lift and moment are modelled as functions of dynamic pressure and control surface deformation:

L = (1/2) * rho * V^2 * S * (C_L_alpha * alpha + C_L_delta * delta)

M = (1/2) * rho * V^2 * S * c * (C_M_alpha * alpha + C_M_delta * delta)

The resulting system is parameterised by airspeed V, allowing flutter boundary identification through eigenvalue analysis.

## Control Architecture

The control input is camber deformation:

u = delta

The control law is:

u = -K x_hat

Where:

- K is obtained using LQR synthesis  
- x_hat is the estimated state  

State estimation is performed using a Luenberger observer:

x_hat_dot = A x_hat + B u + L (y - C x_hat)

The observer enables full-state feedback under partial measurement.
